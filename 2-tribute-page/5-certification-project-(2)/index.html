        <ul>
          <li>1912 - 23 june was born in the city of Maida Vale, London, son of Julius Mathison Turing (1873–1947) and Ethel Sara Turing (1881–1976).</li>
          <li>1918 - At St Michael's primary school, from the age of six to nine. The headmistress recognised his talent, noting that she has "...had clever boys and hardworking boys, but Alan is a genius."</li>
          <li>1922 - Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex (now East Sussex).</li>
          <li>1926 - At the age of 13, he went on to Sherborne School, a boarding independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset.</li>
          <li>1927 - At the age of 15, Turing was solving advanced problems without having studied even elementary calculus.</li>
          <li>1928 - Aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.</li>
          <li>1931 - Turing studied as an undergraduate at King's College, Cambridge, where he was awarded first-class honours in Mathematics.</li>
          <li>1935 - At the age of 22, he was elected a Fellow of King's College on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved a version of the central limit theorem.</li>
          <li>1936 - Turing published his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem". He spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University.</li>
          <li>1937 - Studied as a Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier. </li>
          <li>1938 - He obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton; his dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals, introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing, in which Turing machines are augmented with so-called oracles, allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines.</li>
          <li>1939 - During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The initial design of the British bombe was produced at the UK Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park by Alan Turing, with an important refinement devised in 1940 by Gordon Welchman.
            <p>In December, Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services.</p>
          </li>
          <li>1940 - Turing wrote a report describing the methods he and his colleagues at Bletchley Park had used to break into the German Enigma cipher systems. At Bletchley it was known as 'the Prof's Book.' A copy of this handbook was at last released from secrecy by the American National Security Agency in April 1996, under the title Turing's Treatise on the Enigma.
            <p>Subsequently, a much better original copy was released by the (British)National Archives, box HW 25/3. This also revealed a title which had been lost in the American copy: Mathematical theory of ENIGMA machine.</p>
          </li>
          <li>1941 - Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly "unfazed" by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.</li>
          <li>1942 - Turing devised a technique termed Turingery (or jokingly Turingismus) for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans' new Geheimschreiber (secret writer) machine. This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of wheel-breaking, i.e., a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny's wheels.
            <p>He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who, under the guidance of Max Newman, went on to build the Colossus computer, the world's first programmable digital electronic computer, which replaced a simpler prior machine (the Heath Robinson), and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages. Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher, but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development.</p>
            <p>Turing travelled to the United States in November and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington; he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio.</p>
          </li>
          <li>1943 - He returned to Bletchley Park in March. During his absence, Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8, although Alexander had been de facto head for some time (Turing having little interest in the day-to-day running of the section).
            <p>Turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.
          </li>
          <li>1945 - Turing moved to Hampton, London, while he worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL).</li>
          <li>1946 - Turing was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire. <p>He presented a paper on 19 February, which was the first detailed design of a stored-program computer. Von Neumann's incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing's paper, but it was much less detailed and, according to John R. Womersley, Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division, it "contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing's own".</p>
          </li>
          <li>1947 - His father died. He returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime.</li>
          <li>1948 - Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology.
            <p>He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Despite these accomplishments, Turing was never fully recognised in Britain during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.</p>
            <p>Turing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester.</p>
          </li>
          <li>1949 - He became deputy director of the Computing Machine Laboratory, where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers—the Manchester Mark 1.
            <p>Turing wrote the first version of the Programmer's Manual for this machine, and was recruited by Ferranti as a consultant in the development of their commercialised machine, the Ferranti Mark 1. He continued to be paid consultancy fees by Ferranti until his death.</p>
          </li>
          <li>1951 - He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). Turing was 39 years old, he turned to mathematical biology.</li>
          <li>1952 - Finally published his masterpiece "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" in January.<p>Turing was 39 when he started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Just before Christmas, Turing was walking along Manchester's Oxford Road when he met Murray just outside the Regal Cinema and invited him to lunch.</p>
            <p>On 23 January, Turing's house was burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray.</p>
            <p>Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time, and both men were charged with "gross indecency" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing's solicitor "reserved his defence", i.e., did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations.</p>
          </li>
          <li>1953 - He accepted the option of injections of what was then called stilboestrol (now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES), a synthetic oestrogen; this feminization of his body was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused breast tissue to form, fulfilling in the literal sense Turing's prediction that "no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I've not found out".</li>
          <li>1954 - On 8 June, at his house at 43 Adlington Road, Wilmslow, Turing's housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day at the age of 41.
            <p>Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death. When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide, it was speculated that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide.</p>
            <p>Andrew Hodges and another biographer, David Leavitt, have both speculated that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), his favourite fairy tale. Both men noted that (in Leavitt's words) he took "an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew".</p>
            <p>Turing's remains were cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954, and his ashes were scattered in the gardens of the crematorium, just as his father's had been.</p>

      <div class="curiosities" id="curiosities-dark">
        <h1>Curiosities</h1>
        <hr class="medium" />
        <h2>Theoretical computer</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In one of his articles, on computable numbers, he argued that there are problems that have no solution and that not every logical statement is able to be proved from any formal system of mathematics. The conclusion contradicts the theory of mathematician David Hilbert, who believed that it is impossible for something to exist in mathematics whose truth could never be discovered. He devised a mechanical process that could tell when a logical procedure could be proven or not.</p>
        <p>This is how the Turing Machine was born, a hypothetical device that would change its function as needed, basing its entire operation on a large number of calculations in a binary system, allowing it to define and, when possible, solve problems through a sequence of steps. Hence the logic of the algorithm and of all modern computing.</p>
        <hr class="large" />
        <h2>The visionary</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Many decades before Artificial Intelligence came to smartphones, Turing created a test that Siri is still a long way from passing. In 1950, he already predicted that one day the processing of machines would reach the performance of the human brain. In the article Computational Machinery and Intelligence, he introduced the concept of “imitation game”. Thus, a machine would pass a Turing test when talking to a human being without the latter realizing that it is an artificial intelligence.</p>
        <hr class="large" />
        <h2>Secret agent</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>In a Victorian mansion in the town of Bletchley, a group of geniuses hired by the British intelligence service was assembled during World War II to crack the German military code generated by the Enigma, a supposedly impenetrable encryption machine.</p>
        <p>With the team, the mathematician began working on the production of a machine called “bombe”. The instrument identified weaknesses in the coding and was responsible for revealing the position of German troops, which helped to greatly shorten the war.</p>
        <hr class="large" />
        <h2>Christopher Morcom</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Collan Morcom (13 July 1911 – 13 February 1930), who has been described as Turing's "first love". Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours, but it was cut short by Morcom's death, in February 1930, from complications of bovine tuberculosis, contracted after drinking infected cow's milk some years previously. The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom.</p>
        <hr class="large" />
        <h2>He was an Olympic-level runner</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>He participated in a few sports, such as rowing, but he loved running. Turing had “a bit of a ‘smelly trainers’ aspect” to his personality,” Hodges said. To work it into his day, he often ran to the places he needed to go. He used to run the 10 miles between the two places where he did most of his work, the National Physical Laboratory and the electronics building on Dollis Hill, beating colleagues who took public transportation to the office</p>
        <p>He joined running clubs, becoming a competitive amateur and winning several races. In 1948, his best marathon time was 2 hours 46 minutes 3 seconds — only 11 minutes slower than the Olympic winning time that year.</p>
        <p>When one of his running club members asked why he trained so vehemently, he replied, “I have such a stressful job that the only way I can get it out of my mind is by running hard.”</p>
        <hr class="large" />
        <h2>"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem"</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>In this paper, Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel's 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. The Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his "universal computing machine" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable: it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. This paper has been called "easily the most influential math paper in history".</p>
        <hr class="large" />
        <h2>Turing's game</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>When not cracking Nazi codes at Bletchley Park, Turing used to play Monopoly with the son of another mathematician, Max Newman. The young William Newman, however, had adapted the game, using the streets of the town of Bletchley. In 2012, to celebrate the centenary of his birth, a version of the game was produced with his name and William's changes, to this day it is on sale in the museum installed in the formerly secret military installation.</p>
        <hr class="large" />
        <h2>List of books</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>The list of books Turing removed from the school library between 1928 and 1930 has recently been made public and reveals that even then, mathematics and physics were his favorite subjects. The only novel on the list was a true story. In the book, The Escaping Club, the author, A. J. Evans, recounts his experiences during the First World War.</p>
        <hr class="large" />
        <h2>The first day of class</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>The first day of class coincided with the 1926 General Strike, in Britain, that stopped the trains from running, but Turing was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles (97 km) from Southampton to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.</p>
        <hr class="large" />
        <h2>Treasure</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>In the 1940s, Turing became worried about losing his savings in the event of a German invasion. In order to protect it, he bought two silver bars weighing 3,200 oz (90 kg) and worth £250 (equivalent to over £8,000 in 2022) and buried them in forest which is now Bletchley Park. Upon returning to dig them up, Turing found that he was unable to break his own code describing where exactly he had hidden them. This, along with the fact that the area had been renovated, meant that he never regained the silver.</p>
        <hr class="large" />
        <h2>He embodied some values of the Hippie movement</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>“He was a hippie before his time,” Hodges said. “He was very casual in those days, and thought very scruffy.” Had he lived a few decades later, he would have worn t-shirts and jeans every day, Hodges added.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t uncommon to see Turing dressed rather shabbily, with bitten nails and without a tie, he said. With his youthful face, he was often mistaken for an undergraduate even in his 30s.</p>
        <p>He also shared the left-leaning views of many of his Kings College compatriots, who included economists John Maynard Keynes and Arthur Cecil Pigou. Though Turing joined the Anti-War Movement in 1933, he never got deeply involved in politics. But watching Hitler’s rise to power in the late 1930s scared him, Hodges said, and it spurred his interest in cryptography, which would later help Great Britain in the war.</p>
        <hr class="large" />
        <h2>He got bad grades and frustrated his teachers</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>Science was a considered a second-class pursuit in English public schools in the 1920s, Hodges said. Turing’s passion for science embarrassed his mother, who had hoped he would study the classics, which was the most acceptable pursuit for gentlemen.But he got bad to mediocre grades in school, followed by many complaints from his teachers. His English teacher wrote:</p>
        <p>“I can forgive his writing, though it is the worst I have ever seen, and I try to view tolerantly his unswerving inexactitude and slipshod, dirty, work, inconsistent though such inexactitude is in a utilitarian; but I cannot forgive the stupidity of his attitude towards sane discussion on the New Testament.”</p>
        <p>His math and science grades weren’t much better. He was nearly stopped from taking the national School Certificate exams on the subject, for fear he would fail.</p>
        <hr class="large" />
        <h2>He stuttered when talking</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>It is true that he had a bit of a stammer, something dramatic portrayals of Turing have exaggerated, Hodges said. He “took his time finding the right words,” he explained. In his biography he notes that a BBC radio producer had called Turing a very difficult person to interview for that reason.</p>
        <hr class="large" />
        <h2>He didn’t keep his sexuality a secret among friends</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>The laws at the time prevented Turing from being openly gay, but he never kept his sexuality secret either. He was open with his social circles at Kings College in Cambridge, which was “an oasis of acceptance” at the time, Hodges said. Many people would have clung to that oasis, he said, but Turing branched out to continue his work.
        </p>
        <p>In 1952, he was arrested and charged with “indecency” after a brief relationship with another man. Defiant, he did not deny the charges. “When he was arrested, the first thing he said was he thought that this shouldn’t be against the law,” Hodges said. “He gave a statement that was unapologetic, that detailed what had happened.”</p>
        <hr class="large" />
        <h2>He refused to let a punishment of chemical castration stop him from working</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>The punishment for homosexuality was chemical castration, a series of hormone injections that left Turing impotent. It also caused gynecomastia, giving him breasts. But Turing refused to let the treatment sway him from his work, keeping up his lively spirit.</p>
        <p>“He dealt with it with as much humor and defiance as you could muster,” Hodges said. “To his close friends, it was obvious it was traumatic. But in no way did he just succumb and decline. He really fought back … by insisting on continuing work as if nothing had happened.”</p>
        <p>He openly talked about the trial, even in the “macho environment” of the computer lab. He mocked the law’s absurdity. In defiance, he traveled abroad to Norway and the Mediterranean, where the gay rights movements were budding.</p>
        <p>Homosexuality was considered a security risk at the time, and the conviction cost Turing his security clearance. That was a harsh blow, and Hodges believes that when he was restricted from leaving the country anymore, it ultimately led Turing to suicide.</p>
        <p>“After he’d been revealed as gay in 1952, he couldn’t do any more secret work,” Hodges said. “It would have been hard to accept that he was not trusted.”</p>

      <ul>
        <li>1912 - 23 june was born in the city of Maida Vale, London, son of Julius Mathison Turing (1873–1947) and Ethel Sara Turing (1881–1976).</li>
        <li>1918 - At St Michael's primary school, from the age of six to nine. The headmistress recognised his talent, noting that she has "...had clever boys and hardworking boys, but Alan is a genius."</li>
        <li>1922 - Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex (now East Sussex).</li>
        <li>1926 - At the age of 13, he went on to Sherborne School, a boarding independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset.</li>
        <li>1927 - At the age of 15, Turing was solving advanced problems without having studied even elementary calculus.</li>
        <li>1928 - Aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.</li>
        <li>1931 - Turing studied as an undergraduate at King's College, Cambridge, where he was awarded first-class honours in Mathematics.</li>
        <li>1935 - At the age of 22, he was elected a Fellow of King's College on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved a version of the central limit theorem.</li>
        <li>1936 - Turing published his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem". He spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University.</li>
        <li>1937 - Studied as a Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier. </li>
        <li>1938 - He obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton; his dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals, introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing, in which Turing machines are augmented with so-called oracles, allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines.</li>
        <li>1939 - During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The initial design of the British bombe was produced at the UK Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park by Alan Turing, with an important refinement devised in 1940 by Gordon Welchman.
          <p>In December, Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services.</p>
        </li>
        <li>1940 - Turing wrote a report describing the methods he and his colleagues at Bletchley Park had used to break into the German Enigma cipher systems. At Bletchley it was known as 'the Prof's Book.' A copy of this handbook was at last released from secrecy by the American National Security Agency in April 1996, under the title Turing's Treatise on the Enigma.
          <p>Subsequently, a much better original copy was released by the (British)National Archives, box HW 25/3. This also revealed a title which had been lost in the American copy: Mathematical theory of ENIGMA machine.</p>
        </li>
        <li>1941 - Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly "unfazed" by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.</li>
        <li>1942 - Turing devised a technique termed Turingery (or jokingly Turingismus) for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans' new Geheimschreiber (secret writer) machine. This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of wheel-breaking, i.e., a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny's wheels.
          <p>He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who, under the guidance of Max Newman, went on to build the Colossus computer, the world's first programmable digital electronic computer, which replaced a simpler prior machine (the Heath Robinson), and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages. Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher, but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development.</p>
          <p>Turing travelled to the United States in November and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington; he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio.</p>
        </li>
        <li>1943 - He returned to Bletchley Park in March. During his absence, Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8, although Alexander had been de facto head for some time (Turing having little interest in the day-to-day running of the section).
          <p>Turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.
        </li>
        <li>1945 - Turing moved to Hampton, London, while he worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL).</li>
        <li>1946 - Turing was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire. <p>He presented a paper on 19 February, which was the first detailed design of a stored-program computer. Von Neumann's incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing's paper, but it was much less detailed and, according to John R. Womersley, Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division, it "contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing's own".</p>
        </li>
        <li>1947 - His father died. He returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime.</li>
        <li>1948 - Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology.
          <p>He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Despite these accomplishments, Turing was never fully recognised in Britain during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.</p>
          <p>Turing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester.</p>
        </li>
        <li>1949 - He became deputy director of the Computing Machine Laboratory, where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers—the Manchester Mark 1.
          <p>Turing wrote the first version of the Programmer's Manual for this machine, and was recruited by Ferranti as a consultant in the development of their commercialised machine, the Ferranti Mark 1. He continued to be paid consultancy fees by Ferranti until his death.</p>
        </li>
        <li>1951 - He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). Turing was 39 years old, he turned to mathematical biology.</li>
        <li>1952 - Finally published his masterpiece "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" in January.<p>Turing was 39 when he started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Just before Christmas, Turing was walking along Manchester's Oxford Road when he met Murray just outside the Regal Cinema and invited him to lunch.</p>
          <p>On 23 January, Turing's house was burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray.</p>
          <p>Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time, and both men were charged with "gross indecency" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing's solicitor "reserved his defence", i.e., did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations.</p>
        </li>
        <li>1953 - He accepted the option of injections of what was then called stilboestrol (now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES), a synthetic oestrogen; this feminization of his body was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused breast tissue to form, fulfilling in the literal sense Turing's prediction that "no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I've not found out".</li>
        <li>1954 - On 8 June, at his house at 43 Adlington Road, Wilmslow, Turing's housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day at the age of 41.
          <p>Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death. When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide, it was speculated that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide.</p>
          <p>Andrew Hodges and another biographer, David Leavitt, have both speculated that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), his favourite fairy tale. Both men noted that (in Leavitt's words) he took "an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew".</p>
          <p>Turing's remains were cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954, and his ashes were scattered in the gardens of the crematorium, just as his father's had been.</p>

    <div class="curiosities" id="curiosities-light">
      <h1>Curiosities</h1>
      <hr class="medium" />
      <h2>Theoretical computer</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>In one of his articles, on computable numbers, he argued that there are problems that have no solution and that not every logical statement is able to be proved from any formal system of mathematics. The conclusion contradicts the theory of mathematician David Hilbert, who believed that it is impossible for something to exist in mathematics whose truth could never be discovered. He devised a mechanical process that could tell when a logical procedure could be proven or not.</p>
      <p>This is how the Turing Machine was born, a hypothetical device that would change its function as needed, basing its entire operation on a large number of calculations in a binary system, allowing it to define and, when possible, solve problems through a sequence of steps. Hence the logic of the algorithm and of all modern computing.</p>
      <hr class="large" />
      <h2>The visionary</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>Many decades before Artificial Intelligence came to smartphones, Turing created a test that Siri is still a long way from passing. In 1950, he already predicted that one day the processing of machines would reach the performance of the human brain. In the article Computational Machinery and Intelligence, he introduced the concept of “imitation game”. Thus, a machine would pass a Turing test when talking to a human being without the latter realizing that it is an artificial intelligence.</p>
      <hr class="large" />
      <h2>Secret agent</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>In a Victorian mansion in the town of Bletchley, a group of geniuses hired by the British intelligence service was assembled during World War II to crack the German military code generated by the Enigma, a supposedly impenetrable encryption machine.</p>
      <p>With the team, the mathematician began working on the production of a machine called “bombe”. The instrument identified weaknesses in the coding and was responsible for revealing the position of German troops, which helped to greatly shorten the war.</p>
      <hr class="large" />
      <h2>Christopher Morcom</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Collan Morcom (13 July 1911 – 13 February 1930), who has been described as Turing's "first love". Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours, but it was cut short by Morcom's death, in February 1930, from complications of bovine tuberculosis, contracted after drinking infected cow's milk some years previously. The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom.</p>
      <hr class="large" />
      <h2>He was an Olympic-level runner</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>He participated in a few sports, such as rowing, but he loved running. Turing had “a bit of a ‘smelly trainers’ aspect” to his personality,” Hodges said. To work it into his day, he often ran to the places he needed to go. He used to run the 10 miles between the two places where he did most of his work, the National Physical Laboratory and the electronics building on Dollis Hill, beating colleagues who took public transportation to the office</p>
      <p>He joined running clubs, becoming a competitive amateur and winning several races. In 1948, his best marathon time was 2 hours 46 minutes 3 seconds — only 11 minutes slower than the Olympic winning time that year.</p>
      <p>When one of his running club members asked why he trained so vehemently, he replied, “I have such a stressful job that the only way I can get it out of my mind is by running hard.”</p>
      <hr class="large" />
      <h2>"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem"</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>In this paper, Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel's 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. The Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his "universal computing machine" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable: it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. This paper has been called "easily the most influential math paper in history".</p>
      <hr class="large" />
      <h2>Turing's game</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>When not cracking Nazi codes at Bletchley Park, Turing used to play Monopoly with the son of another mathematician, Max Newman. The young William Newman, however, had adapted the game, using the streets of the town of Bletchley. In 2012, to celebrate the centenary of his birth, a version of the game was produced with his name and William's changes, to this day it is on sale in the museum installed in the formerly secret military installation.</p>
      <hr class="large" />
      <h2>List of books</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>The list of books Turing removed from the school library between 1928 and 1930 has recently been made public and reveals that even then, mathematics and physics were his favorite subjects. The only novel on the list was a true story. In the book, The Escaping Club, the author, A. J. Evans, recounts his experiences during the First World War.</p>
      <hr class="large" />
      <h2>The first day of class</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>The first day of class coincided with the 1926 General Strike, in Britain, that stopped the trains from running, but Turing was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles (97 km) from Southampton to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.</p>
      <hr class="large" />
      <h2>Treasure</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>In the 1940s, Turing became worried about losing his savings in the event of a German invasion. In order to protect it, he bought two silver bars weighing 3,200 oz (90 kg) and worth £250 (equivalent to over £8,000 in 2022) and buried them in forest which is now Bletchley Park. Upon returning to dig them up, Turing found that he was unable to break his own code describing where exactly he had hidden them. This, along with the fact that the area had been renovated, meant that he never regained the silver.</p>
      <hr class="large" />
      <h2>He embodied some values of the Hippie movement</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>“He was a hippie before his time,” Hodges said. “He was very casual in those days, and thought very scruffy.” Had he lived a few decades later, he would have worn t-shirts and jeans every day, Hodges added.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t uncommon to see Turing dressed rather shabbily, with bitten nails and without a tie, he said. With his youthful face, he was often mistaken for an undergraduate even in his 30s.</p>
      <p>He also shared the left-leaning views of many of his Kings College compatriots, who included economists John Maynard Keynes and Arthur Cecil Pigou. Though Turing joined the Anti-War Movement in 1933, he never got deeply involved in politics. But watching Hitler’s rise to power in the late 1930s scared him, Hodges said, and it spurred his interest in cryptography, which would later help Great Britain in the war.</p>
      <hr class="large" />
      <h2>He got bad grades and frustrated his teachers</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>Science was a considered a second-class pursuit in English public schools in the 1920s, Hodges said. Turing’s passion for science embarrassed his mother, who had hoped he would study the classics, which was the most acceptable pursuit for gentlemen.But he got bad to mediocre grades in school, followed by many complaints from his teachers. His English teacher wrote:</p>
      <p>“I can forgive his writing, though it is the worst I have ever seen, and I try to view tolerantly his unswerving inexactitude and slipshod, dirty, work, inconsistent though such inexactitude is in a utilitarian; but I cannot forgive the stupidity of his attitude towards sane discussion on the New Testament.”</p>
      <p>His math and science grades weren’t much better. He was nearly stopped from taking the national School Certificate exams on the subject, for fear he would fail.</p>
      <hr class="large" />
      <h2>He stuttered when talking</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>It is true that he had a bit of a stammer, something dramatic portrayals of Turing have exaggerated, Hodges said. He “took his time finding the right words,” he explained. In his biography he notes that a BBC radio producer had called Turing a very difficult person to interview for that reason.</p>
      <hr class="large" />
      <h2>He didn’t keep his sexuality a secret among friends</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>The laws at the time prevented Turing from being openly gay, but he never kept his sexuality secret either. He was open with his social circles at Kings College in Cambridge, which was “an oasis of acceptance” at the time, Hodges said. Many people would have clung to that oasis, he said, but Turing branched out to continue his work.
      </p>
      <p>In 1952, he was arrested and charged with “indecency” after a brief relationship with another man. Defiant, he did not deny the charges. “When he was arrested, the first thing he said was he thought that this shouldn’t be against the law,” Hodges said. “He gave a statement that was unapologetic, that detailed what had happened.”</p>
      <hr class="large" />
      <h2>He refused to let a punishment of chemical castration stop him from working</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>The punishment for homosexuality was chemical castration, a series of hormone injections that left Turing impotent. It also caused gynecomastia, giving him breasts. But Turing refused to let the treatment sway him from his work, keeping up his lively spirit.</p>
      <p>“He dealt with it with as much humor and defiance as you could muster,” Hodges said. “To his close friends, it was obvious it was traumatic. But in no way did he just succumb and decline. He really fought back … by insisting on continuing work as if nothing had happened.”</p>
      <p>He openly talked about the trial, even in the “macho environment” of the computer lab. He mocked the law’s absurdity. In defiance, he traveled abroad to Norway and the Mediterranean, where the gay rights movements were budding.</p>
      <p>Homosexuality was considered a security risk at the time, and the conviction cost Turing his security clearance. That was a harsh blow, and Hodges believes that when he was restricted from leaving the country anymore, it ultimately led Turing to suicide.</p>
      <p>“After he’d been revealed as gay in 1952, he couldn’t do any more secret work,” Hodges said. “It would have been hard to accept that he was not trusted.”</p>
