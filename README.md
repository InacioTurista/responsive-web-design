# responsive-web-design

a free HTML and CSS course from - freecodecamp.org

I will use this repositorie to post my exercises and certification projects from this course

I'm posting my exercises daily, but I didn't do one per day, especially the projects I took at least five days each, cause I was learning slowly, trying not to rush things. At this moment I'm doing the course JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures in freeCodeCamp.
